// In plain JavaScript, if you want to do the same thing to several elements,
// you would need to write code to loop through all of the selected elements.

// With jQuesr,when a selector returns multiple elements,
// you can update all of them using one method. (No need to use loop)



//$('li em').addClass('seasonal');    // all 'em' that are descendants of 'li'
//$('li.hot').addClass('favorite');   // all 'li' with class 'hot'
